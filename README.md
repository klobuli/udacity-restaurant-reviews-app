# Restaurant Reviews App

This project was created as a part of the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## About this project

I was provided with a [static design](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to ensure that the website will still be usable without an internet connection (offline first approach).

## How to run the application

In order to run the application, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local computer using the `git clone` command:

`git clone https://github.com/klobuli/udacity-restaurant-reviews-app.git`

Alternatively you can [download this .zip file](https://github.com/klobuli/udacity-restaurant-reviews-app/archive/master.zip).

2. Use the `cd udacity-restaurant-reviews-app` command to change into the projects' directory.

3. Inside the directory, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Using the `python -v` command, check the version of Python you have. In case you have version 2.x installed, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use). For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to [Python's website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. With the server running, visit the site `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
